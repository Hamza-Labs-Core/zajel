  # NOTE: Flutter integration tests are skipped in CI due to platform limitations:
  # - Linux desktop: VmServiceDisappearedException issues (flutter/flutter#101031)
  # - Web: Not supported by Flutter integration test framework
  # - macOS: Available but skipped to reduce runner costs
  # - Android/iOS: Emulator/simulator complexity and CI runtime costs
  #
  # For detailed information and local testing instructions, see:
  #   docs/testing/CI_LIMITATIONS.md
  #
  # Run integration tests locally with the test runner script:
  #   packages/app/run_integration_tests.sh
  #
  # Or run directly with Flutter:
  #   flutter test integration_test/ -d linux
  #   flutter test integration_test/ -d macos
