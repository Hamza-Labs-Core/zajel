# Zajel Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 5, 2026*

## Overview

Zajel is a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging application. Your privacy is our priority. This policy explains what data we collect and how we handle it.

## Data We Collect

### Stored Locally on Your Device
- **Display Name**: The name you choose to identify yourself to other users
- **Messages**: All messages are stored only on your device
- **Transferred Files**: Files you send or receive are stored locally
- **Peer Information**: Names and connection details of people you communicate with
- **Encryption Keys**: Your private keys are stored securely on your device

### Data We Do NOT Collect
- We do not operate any servers that store your messages
- We do not collect analytics or usage data
- We do not track your location
- We do not collect device identifiers for advertising
- We have no access to your message content

## How Your Data Is Used

- **Peer-to-peer communication**: Messages travel directly between devices
- **Local storage only**: All data remains on your device
- **No cloud sync**: Your messages are not backed up to any server

## Data Security

### End-to-End Encryption
All communications in Zajel are end-to-end encrypted using:
- **X25519**: For secure key exchange
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: For message encryption

This means only you and the person you're communicating with can read your messages. No one else - including us - can access your conversations.

### Local Security
- Encryption keys are stored in your device's secure storage
- Messages cannot be decrypted without your device

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data with third parties.**

- No advertising partners
- No analytics services
- No data brokers

Messages are transmitted directly between devices over encrypted connections. No intermediary servers have access to your content.

## Data Retention and Deletion

### How to Delete Your Data
- **Uninstall the app**: This removes all locally stored data including messages, files, and encryption keys
- **Clear app data**: Use your device's settings to clear Zajel's data

### Blocking Users
You can block users within the app. Blocked users cannot send you messages or see when you're online.

## Children's Privacy

Zajel is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
